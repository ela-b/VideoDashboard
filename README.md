VideoDashboard
==============

This is web a web dashboard displaying the latest 50 videos from YoutTube that have a given tag. The app has been built using: 
- [ObjectPath - the query language for semi structured data](http://adriank.github.io/ObjectPath/), which makes it easy to discover the relevant embeddable link from the messy data YouTube sends via its API and later plug it into the app.
- [BLSL language - a declarative language for data manipulation](http://docs.asyncode.com/text/BLSL-reference), which allows for manipulating data / build the backend without programming.
